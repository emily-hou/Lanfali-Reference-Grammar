# Lanfali
Lanfali is a constructed language I created for my undergrad Conlanging course. Creating a constructed language is a valuable tool to learn about many linguistic concepts and apply them in a novel way.

My project includes a complete reference grammar and sample text, and several programs using LTI tools:

Talking clock: A program that tells the time in Lanfali, using the Festival Speech Synthesis program.
Chatbot: A text-based Lanfali chatbot, created using PyAIML.
